Inspiration Forge: Django site powering InspirationForge.com
=============================================================

Inspiration Forge is a blog focused on providing creative sparks, especially for tabletop role-playing games and creative writing.

For now, this project is simply a blog engine. I created it to teach myself Django and to build a foundation for future explorations into procedurally-generated creative aids. A live (but no longer maintained) deployment of the engine can be found at http://inspirationforge.herokuapp.com/.

Inspiration Forge makes use of Django, Postgres, Bootstrap 3, Gunicorn, Heroku, Amazon AWS S3, and test-driven development.
